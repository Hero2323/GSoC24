The provided text is a modified version of the Apache License 2.0. The key differences between the original and the text provided are:

1. The copyright holder is ""Kakao Brain"" instead of the Apache Software Foundation.
2. The disclaimer section has been slightly modified, but it still maintains the same spirit as the original Apache License 2.0 disclaimer.

The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). It allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the licensed work, as long as the copyright notice, the license terms, and any disclaimer are included in all copies or substantial portions of the work. The license also includes a patent grant clause, which is not present in the text provided, but it is generally understood that the ASF grants a patent license to the software under the Apache License 2.0. However, the text provided does not explicitly state this patent grant clause."
