```

The surrounding context is:

```
Enable the composability between Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Data Parallelism(DP) in PyTorch when using DDP. We need to convert Parameters which are DTensors to local tensors before wrapping with data parallelism API. We then register two hooks, one for converting local tensors back to DTensor preforward and one to convert DTensors back to tensors after Forward. By integrating this way, we avoid any special handling of DTensor parameters by DDP and get DTensor's gradients propagated back to DP, e.g. gradient buckets of DDP.
