KVM should return supported EVMCS version range
Allocate memory regions for nested VMX tests.** Input Args:*   vm - The VM to allocate guest-virtual addresses in.** Output Args:*   p_vmx_gva - The guest virtual address for the struct vmx_pages.** Return:*   Pointer to structure with the addresses of the VMX areas.
Setup of a region of guest memory for the vmxon region.
Setup of a region of guest memory for a vmcs.
Setup of a region of guest memory for the MSR bitmap.
Setup of a region of guest memory for the shadow VMCS.
Setup of a region of guest memory for the VMREAD and VMWRITE bitmaps.
Ensure bits in CR0 and CR4 are valid in VMX operation:* - Bit X is 1 in _FIXED0: bit X is fixed to 1 in CRx.* - Bit X is 0 in _FIXED1: bit X is fixed to 0 in CRx.
Enable VMX operation
Configure IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL MSR to allow VMXON:*  Bit 0: Lock bit. If clear, VMXON causes a #GP.*  Bit 2: Enables VMXON outside of SMX operation. If clear, VMXON*    outside of SMX causes a #GP.
Enter VMX root operation.
Load a VMCS.
Setup shadow VMCS, do not load it yet.
Initialize the control fields to the most basic settings possible.

64-bit host
64-bit guest
Initialize the host state fields based on the current host state, with* the exception of HOST_RSP and HOST_RIP, which should be set by vmlaunch* or vmresume.
Initialize the guest state fields essentially as a clone of* the host state fields. Some host state fields have fixed* values, and we set the corresponding guest state fields accordingly.
Entry already present.  Assert that the caller doesn't want* a hugepage at this level, and that there isn't a hugepage at* this level.
For now mark these as accessed and dirty because the only* testcase we have needs that.  Can be reconsidered later.
Map a range of EPT guest physical addresses to the VM's physical address** Input Args:*   vm - Virtual Machine*   nested_paddr - Nested guest physical address to map*   paddr - VM Physical Address*   size - The size of the range to map*   level - The level at which to map the range** Output Args: None** Return: None** Within the VM given by vm, creates a nested guest translation for the* page range starting at nested_paddr to the page range starting at paddr.
Prepare an identity extended page table that maps all the* physical pages in VM.

Let me explain the selections:

* **('SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only',)**: This line explicitly states the license identifier, making it highly relevant.
* **('Setup of a region of guest memory for the vmxon region.',)**:  While not directly mentioning a license, this line appears within a context where license information is likely to be found (e.g., within a file dedicated to license details).
* **('Setup of a region of guest memory for the shadow VMCS.',)**: Similar to the previous line, its context suggests a potential license association.
* **('Allocate memory regions for nested VMX tests.',)**:  Again, the context points towards a section where license information might be present.
* **('Load a VMCS.',)**:  Similar reasoning as above.

Let me break down why:

* **'# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0'**: This line explicitly states the license identifier, making it directly relevant.
* **'LOCAL_HDRS += $(selfdir)/pidfd/pidfd.h'**: While not as direct, this line is likely referencing a file that contains license information, given its context within a build system.
